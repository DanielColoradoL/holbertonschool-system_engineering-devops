Web Stack Diagram and System Overview
Introduction
Welcome to our project's README! In this document, we will provide an overview of the web stack we've built as part of the SysAdmin/DevOps track projects. Our focus lies on creating a robust and scalable infrastructure that ensures high availability and performance for our web applications.

Web Stack Diagram
We have designed a comprehensive web stack consisting of various components, each serving a specific purpose. Below is a brief overview of our web stack:


Load Balancer (LB): The load balancer serves as the entry point for incoming web traffic. It distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and prevent overload on any single server.

Web Servers: These servers host our web applications and serve content to users. They are responsible for processing client requests, executing application logic, and generating dynamic responses.

Database Server: The database server stores and manages the data used by our web applications. It ensures data integrity, persistence, and efficient retrieval through structured query processing.

File Storage: This component provides a scalable and reliable storage solution for serving static assets such as images, videos, and documents to users.

Explanation of Components
Load Balancer (LB): The load balancer employs algorithms like round-robin or least connections to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple web servers. This helps in achieving high availability and fault tolerance by eliminating single points of failure (SPOF) and distributing the workload efficiently.

Web Servers: These servers host the application code and handle client requests. They interact with the database server to retrieve or store data, generate dynamic content, and deliver responses to users.

Database Server: The database server manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations. It ensures data consistency, reliability, and performance by employing mechanisms like replication, sharding, or clustering for redundancy and scalability.

File Storage: This component provides a centralized repository for storing static files. It enables efficient content delivery and reduces the load on web servers by serving static assets directly to clients.

System Redundancy
System redundancy is a critical aspect of our architecture, aimed at minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous availability of services. We achieve redundancy in the following ways:

Load Balancer Redundancy: Deploying multiple load balancers in a high-availability configuration ensures uninterrupted traffic distribution even if one load balancer fails.

Web Server Redundancy: Running multiple web servers behind the load balancer allows for seamless failover in case of server failures or maintenance activities. The load balancer automatically redirects traffic to healthy servers, maintaining service availability.

Database Redundancy: Implementing database replication or clustering ensures data redundancy and fault tolerance. In the event of a database server failure, standby replicas can take over seamlessly, preventing data loss or service interruption.

Acronyms
LAMP: Stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python. It is a popular web development stack used for building dynamic web applications.

SPOF: Stands for Single Point of Failure. It refers to a component in a system that, if it fails, will cause the entire system to fail.

QPS: Stands for Queries Per Second. It is a metric used to measure the number of database queries processed by a system in one second.
